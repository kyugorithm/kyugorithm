### Who am I?
I serve as the head of the Vision AI team at VIVE STUDIOS, guiding the evolution of video production through cutting-edge AI innovations. My primary area of expertise is in generative models, particularly GANs and diffusion models. I focus on developing virtual human content creation, spanning a range of applications such as face swapping, re-aging, and talking head generation. Within Virtual Production, I harness foundational models like segmentation to ensure precision and quality. Furthermore, I address intricate challenges using deep learning to solve issues such as De-moire and SDE effects. As I look to the future, I am committed to integrating pioneering AI technologies, such as Nerf, super-resolution, and frame interpolation, to set new standards in broadcast content creation.
