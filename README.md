### Who am I?
I serve as Senior ML Engineer at Coupang Play. I specialize in generative models (GANs, Diffusion, and LLMs partially), with a focus on creating interactive virtual humans. My work bridges the gap between research and engineering, effectively transforming concepts into practical applications. Additionally, I have experience in deploying generative Vision AI services on cloud platforms, such as AWS.
